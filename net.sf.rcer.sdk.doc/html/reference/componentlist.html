<h2>Component List</h2>

<!-- TODO -->

<!--  
<p>Unfortunately, SAP licensing restrictions do not permit
redistribution of the SAP Java Connector (JCo). This makes the
installation process a bit more complex than for the usual Eclipse
extension. You'll have to perform three steps to get a working
installation of the SAP R/3 Connector:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download and install the Import Wizard.</li>
	<li>Generate the JCo bundles and fragments.</li>
	<li>Download and install the remaining parts of the connector SDK.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these instructions assume that you have already <a
	href="http://service.sap.com/connectors" target=_new"> downloaded
the JCo archives</a> (registration required).
<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You'll need a recent version of Eclipse 3.4 to install and use
the SDK. You'll also need the Eclipse Modeling Framework and a recent
version of openArchitectureWare.org 4.3 to use the SDK. Both EMF and oAW
are development-time dependencies only; applications developed with the
Connector SDK can be distributed withouth EMF and oAW.</p>

<h3>Installation of the Import Wizard</h3>

<p>If you are reading this in the on-line help system of your
Eclipse installation, you already have the Import Wizard installed. In
this case, you can skip to the next step, generating the JCo Bundles.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add <tt>http://rcer.sf.net/update-site</tt> to the list of
	update sites: Select <i>Help</i> - <i>Software Updates</i>, switch to
	the <i>Available Software</i> tab, press <i>Add Site</i> and add the
	location.</li>
	<li>Expand the update site entry and the category and select <i>Import
	Wizard for SAP Java Connector</i>. <b>Important:</b> Do <b>NOT</b> select
	the SDK yet - you won't be able to install it because of missing
	dependencies.</li>
	<li>Perform the installation and restart the Eclipse Workbench.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Generating the JCo Bundles and Fragments</h3>

<ol>
	<li>In your Eclipse Workbench, select <i>File</i> - <i>Import...</i>.</li>
	<li>From the list of import sources, select <i>SAP R/3
	Connector</i> - <i>Create SAP Java Connector Plug-ins</i> and choose <i>Next</i>.</li>
	<li>If you haven't done so yet, <a
		href="http://service.sap.com/connectors" target=_new">download the
	JCo archives</a> for the platforms you want to support (registration
	required). Note that the Connector was designed to use JCo versions 3
	and up - it will <b>not</b> work with versions prior to 3.0.0.</li>
	<li>Select the locations of the downloaded archives. Obviously,
	you need to specify at least one file before continuing.</li>
	<li>
	<p>On the last page, you can choose whether you want to create the
	plug-in and fragment projects for the platforms you have selected
	archive files for. If the projects already exist in your workspace,
	you'll be prompted whether you want to replace the existing projects
	instead.</p>
	<p>You can also select whether you want to export the generated
	plug-ins to the <tt>dropins</tt> folder of your Eclipse installation
	automatically. If you deselect this option, you'll have to install the
	plug-ins manually before you can install the SDK. <b>Please provide
	feedback if the export to the <tt>dropins</tt> folder works - this is
	more or less experimental coding with a lot of guesswork regarding the
	location of the <tt>dropins</tt> folder.</b></p>
	<p>Select <i>Finish</i>. This will generate the projects and export
	them if you have selected the corresponding option. This might take
	some time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Restart the Eclipse Workbench.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Installation of the Connector SDK</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Help</i> - <i>Software Updates</i>, switch to the <i>Available
	Software</i> tab.</li>
	<li>Expand the update site entry added when installing the wizard
	and the category below. Select <i>SAP R/3 Connector SDK</i>.</li>
	<li>Perform the installation and restart the Eclipse Workbench.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>After the installation is completed, select <i>Help</i> - <i>Help
Contents</i> and visit the online documentation topic <i>SAP R/3
Connector</i> for more information.
