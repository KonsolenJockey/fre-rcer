<h2>Component Overview</h2>

<p>The SAP R/3 Connector consists of a number of plug-ins and features with a complex set of dependencies.
This chapter provides an overview of the components and gives some usage examples.</p>

<p>The connector consists of runtime components and development tools. The runtime components are typically
deployed along with any application created using the connector, while the development tools are built on 
top of these runtime components and provide additional functions, but also require more dependencies to be 
present e. g. the JDT or oAW). The runtime components depend on the SAP Java Connector (JCo) plug-ins to be
present, and since the development tools depend on the runtime components, the same restriction applies to 
them. To help creating these JCo plug-ins, there's a third component - the JCo Import Wizard - that is 
completely independent of the other plug-ins and can be used to "bootstrap" the installation process.</p>


<h3>JCo Import Wizard</h3>

<p>The import wizard consists of two plug-ins and a feature. The feature <tt>net.sf.rcer.import</tt> is
required to turn the import wizard into a separate deployment unit that can be installed from the update site. 
The import wizard itself is contained in the plug-in <tt>net.sf.rcer.jcoimport</tt>, its documentation in a 
separate plug-in <tt>net.sf.rcer.jcoimport.doc</tt>. The latter depends on a plug-in named <tt>net.sf.rcer.doc</tt>
that provides a common structure for the documentation of the entire connector.</p>


<h3>Runtime Components</h3>

<p>The runtime components contain functions like connection management, tracing and some tools like the 
<tt>TableReader</tt>. The runtime components are distributed into the plug-ins <tt>net.sf.rcer.conn</tt> 
(for the UI-independent parts) and <tt>net.sf.rcer.conn.ui</tt> (for the parts that require the UI to be present). 
The runtime components should also work without UI access, but that has not been extensively tested yet.</p>

<p>The documentation of the runtime components is contained in the plug-in <tt>net.sf.rcer.conn.doc</tt> that 
also depends on <tt>net.sf.rcer.doc</tt>.</p>

<p>The runtime components are <b>not</b> contained in a special feature.</p> 


<h3>Development Tools</h3>

<p>The development tools are bundled in a feature named <tt>net.sf.rcer.sdk</tt>. This feature also contains
the runtime components, the examples and the generated source plug-ins.</p>

<p>The RFC mapping language is defined in <tt>net.sf.rcer.rfcgen</tt>; the editor and generator are contained
in <tt>net.sf.rcer.rfcgen.editor</tt> and <tt>net.sf.rcer.rfcgen.generatory</tt> respectively.</p>

<p>The documentation is distributed among several plug-ins: <tt>net.sf.rcer.sdk.doc</tt> for the general topics, 
<tt>net.sf.rcer.rfcgen.doc</tt> for the RFC mapping language. These plug-ins each depend on a plug-in named 
<tt>net.sf.rcer.doc</tt> that provides a common structure for the documentation of the entire connector.</p>

<p>The development tools also contain an experimental repository object model that is contained in  
<tt>net.sf.rcer.rom</tt>.</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The examples are contained in several plug-ins that form separate RCP applications:</p>
<ul> 
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.example.rfcgen.pojo.call</tt></li>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.example.rfcgen.pojo.rr</tt></li>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.example.traditional</tt></li>
</ul>


<h3>Other Plug-Ins</h3>

<p>If you start digging into the internals of the connector, you may encounter one of the following plug-ins:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer</tt> is a feature that is used for the build process only.</li>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.conn.test</tt> contains the automated tests for <tt>net.sf.rcer.conn</tt> that do not require
a connection to a SAP R/3 system.</li> 
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.conn.test-r3</tt> contains the automated tests for <tt>net.sf.rcer.conn</tt> that require
a connection to a SAP R/3 system.</li>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.rom.test</tt> contains the automated tests for <tt>net.sf.rcer.rom</tt>. These tests require 
a connection to a SAP R/3 system.</li>
<li><tt>net.sf.rcer.test.provider</tt> contains the connection providers for the automated tests.</li>
</ul>
