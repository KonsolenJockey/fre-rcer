This file describes the layout of the build system

  scripts   contains the shell scripts to drive the build system.

  distfiles contains the 3rd party packages required for the build - Eclipse, oAW and so on. 
            These files are not kept in the repository - download them manually and put them there.

  base      contains the Eclipse installation that is used as the "host" system for the build.
            This is where baseLocation points to. The contents of this folder can be recreated using
            the script 01-RecreateBase.sh
  
  export    contains the project contents that were exported from the repository. We use a staged 
            approach here - export the contents from the repository into checkout, then copy them over
            to the build directory. The reason for this is the incredibly poor performance of the 
            SourceForge subversion servers. The contents of this folder can be fetched using 
            the script 02-ExportProjects.sh
