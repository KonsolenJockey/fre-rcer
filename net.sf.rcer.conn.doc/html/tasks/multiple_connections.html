<h2>Using Multiple Connections</h2>

<p>The connector allows you to open multiple connections to any number of SAP R/3 systems
at the same time. Using this feature, you can rapidly switch between different systems. 
Some applications might also take advantage of this feature, e. g. to compare or transfer
data between different systems. Most of the time though, you'll want to work with the 
connections one at a time.</p>

<p>The connection that is currently displayed in the status widget is the so-called 
<i>primary connection</i>. Unless an application specifically requests another connection, 
it will always use this connection when working with the remote system. You can switch to 
another connection by right-clicking on the status display and choosing the desired primary 
connection from the submenu <i>Select Primary Connection</i>. Note that this menu will only 
appear if there are multiple active connections.</p>

<p><b>You should avoid connecting to the same system and client with the same user more 
than once. Although the connector can handle this, this is a rather error-prone situation.</b></p>
