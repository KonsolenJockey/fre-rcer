<h2>Managing Connections</h2>

<p>In order to use the SAP R/3 connector, you have to enter the 
<a href="connection_data.html">connection data</a> first. Consult your system 
administrator if you're unsure about the connection settings.</p>

<p>The connector provides a so-called <i>trim widget</i>, a small part of the 
status bar, that displays the current connection status. If you're not connected to
a SAP R/3 system, the status display is gray:</p>

<p>You can right-click on this status display to open a context menu that will allow 
you to connect to one of the systems defined in the connection settings. This will bring 
up the login dialog:</p>

<p>As long as the connection is active, the status display is green and shows the 
system ID and client you're connected to:</p>

<p>You can use the context menu to disconnect from the system. The connection is also 
closed automatically when closing the application.</p>

<p>Note that applications may request an active connection at any time. If you're currently
connected to a system, that connection will be used; if you're not connected, the login
dialog will be shown.</p>
