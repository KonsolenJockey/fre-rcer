<h2>RFC Mapping Language Concepts</h2>

<p>The SAP R/3 Connector SDK contains a tool to facilitate the task of performing RFC calls. Instead of writing
the Java coding to perform the input and output mapping manually, you can generate the classes from a mapping 
definition that is written in a compact language. The SDK even contains a wizard that generates a basic mapping
definition by examining the function module definition.</p>

<p>Before writing the mapping definition, you have to decide whether you want to use <i>call-style mapping</i> or
<i>request-response-style mapping</i>. If you use call-style mapping, a single call class is generated. You 
prepare an instance of this class by setting the input parameters, then execute the call. The results of the 
function module execution are written into the instance of the call class. In other words, this mapping style
works in-place. If you use request-response-style mapping, you have to use two classes. You prepare an instance of 
a request class - much the same way you would with a call class - and then execute the call. This does not change
the request, but creates an instance of a response class instead. The following chapters contain detailed examples
of both mapping styles.</p> 

<p>To generate a basic mapping definition, make sure you're able to connect to a SAP R/3 system. Then, execute the 
following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select <i>File</i> - <i>New</i> - <i>Project</i> and choose <i>SAP R/3 Connector</i> - <i>RFC Wrapper Project</i>.</li>
<li>Remove the empty <tt>model.rfc</tt> from the source directory.</li>
<li>Select <i>File</i> - <i>Import</i> and choose <i>SAP R/3 Connector</i> - <i>Create RFC Mapping Definition</i>.</li>
<li>Enter one or more function modules you want to include into your mapping definition.</li>
<li>Enter the name of the target Java package for the generated classes and choose the mapping style.</li>
<li>Place the file as <tt>model.rfc</tt> into the source directory.</li>
<li>Right-click on the generated <tt>workflow.oaw</tt> and choose <i>Run as</i> - <i>oAW Workflow</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate the mapping definition and the classes. Now you can examine the generated classes and,
if necessary, change the mapping definition and repeat the last step as often as you like.</p>

<p>The generated classes support property change notification and can therefore be used in JFace data binding
contexts without further adaption.</p>

<p>Note that you can use multiple mapping definitions to keep the definitions organized - just adapt the workflow
definition accordingly</p>.
